# Building Access Navigation Program using Speech Interaction

The Building Access Navigation Program using Speech Interaction is a senior project for the Computer Engineering program. The program aims to create a system that enables users to navigate a building easily using voice commands and video navigation. In addition to this, the program can answer queries about the professor's location and the weather, providing users with additional information.

This project utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines to provide an intuitive and interactive experience for users. The program is built using Next.js for the front-end, Express for the backend, and Firebase to store video for navigation. Furthermore, the program integrates with the Google TTS API to provide audio responses and Dialogflow for understanding user intent.

The program also features additional functionalities such as the ability to inquire about the professor's whereabouts and weather conditions such as pollution levels and temperature in the user's current location. Our goal is to develop a reliable, efficient, and accessible system that can improve the quality of life for people with disabilities and provide valuable information to users.

## Installation

1. ### Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mekkkwiz/final-project-app
    ```

2. ### Install dependencies

    ```bash
    cd final-project-app
    npm install

    cd client_v2
    npm install
    ```

3. ### Create a .env file with the following variables

    ```.env
    GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    DIALOGFLOW_SESSION_ID="unique-session-id"
    DIALOGFLOW_SESSION_LANGUAGE_CODE="th"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL="your-client-email"
    GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
    ```

4. ### Start the server

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Alternatively, you can use Docker to run the program. Follow these steps to install using Docker

1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mekkkwiz/final-project-app
    ```

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

    ```bash
    cd final-project-app
    ```

4. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t building-access-navigation .
    ```

5. Run the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000 building-access-navigation
    ```
